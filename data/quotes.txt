Junipero Serra

David Cameron
While formal schooling is an important advantage, it is not a guarantee of success nor is its absence a fatal handicap.

H. L. Hunt
'Get along, go along' is not an inspirational philosophy, and only God knows how much moral cowardice it has covered up over the years. Serve your time, collect your chits, and cash 'em in for your home state? No, I'd say we could ask for more than that from our senators.
Molly Ivins

Edgar Bronfman, Jr.
Other people's success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation.
Nicholas Hoult

Robin Williams
Before you can become a millionaire, you must learn to think like one. You must learn how to motivate yourself to counter fear with courage.

I think true success is intrinsic... It's love. It's kindness. It's community.

Marilyn Ferguson
I believe in luck: how else can you explain the success of those you dislike?

Joan of Arc
I think that's a great opportunity, to pick a script where you can build up a good skill. I think the main thing I look for when I look at scripts is if it's inspirational. If it's something that teenagers can relate to. And is it something that the audience is going to get something out of. If not, then it's really not worth doing.

You look at the tremendous success of Facebook. To my mind there is not a lot of commerce going on in these social networking sites. eBay is a community anchored in commerce.

Henry Ward Beecher

Johnny Depp
The most effective way to do it, is to do it.
Amelia Earhart
I'm not here to impose Sharia law, and I'm not here to have a message about disability being inspirational - I'm here to make people laugh. But when I can layer things and make people not only laugh but question, make people not only laugh but be offended... I have to do that.

Soichiro Honda
Success is sweet and sweeter if long delayed and gotten through many struggles and defeats.

William Arthur Ward

Alexander Graham Bell
And when I breathed, my breath was lightning.
Black Elk
Business gives you a massive high. Doing a great deal, coming up with an inspirational solution... It's very addictive. But it doesn't last long. In isolation, it's a bit sterile. It doesn't reward the soul.
John Caudwell
Give light and people will find the way.
Ella Baker
There is a loftier ambition than merely to stand high in the world. It is to stoop down and lift mankind a little higher.

Taylor Kinney
Man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit.
Bernard Williams
The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do.

The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially, the more success you have, the more you look to the other side of the gate.
Celine Dion
I do like alternative rock and rap, but as far as inspirational, then I go full-on orchestra. It fills up your entire being.
Osric Chau
Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.
Mikhail Bakunin
When Bill Clinton ran in '92, and I listened to him, and I had of course known of his record from Arkansas, I found him extraordinarily inspirational, and I voted Democratic.
Wesley Clark
I've a great family, two children to take care of. Then, of course, I do commentary for TV. I do speak about various women's issues around the world - like LGBT, motivational speeches. I have a lot on my plate right now. But eventually, yes, I would like to pass on the knowledge and something that I would like to do.
Martina Navratilova
However things may seem, no evil thing is success and no good thing is failure.
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure.

Paramahansa Yogananda
Success is not in never failing, but rising everytime you fall!

Colin Kaepernick
After a storm comes a calm.
Matthew Henry
Failure is not an option. Everyone has to succeed.
Arnold Schwarzenegger
It is so inspirational, to see that in the world of Westeros, men are answering to women, and they are a force to be reckoned with. It's empowering, and it's inspirational as well, because you're just like, 'This is great!'
Rose Leslie
I've been very lucky to have achieved a lot of the things that I dreamt of achieving as a young man. But, at the end of the day - and I truly believe this - it is not about achieving great wealth or success. Because they don't bring happiness, ultimately.

The secret of my success is my hairspray.
Richard Gere
Whatever you want in life, other people are going to want it too. Believe in yourself enough to accept the idea that you have an equal right to it.
Diane Sawyer
Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure, there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together, and if you're really working, you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.
Peter Guber
People fall forward to success.
Mary Kay Ash
I wonder how many times people give up just before a breakthrough - when they are on the very brink of success.

Sheryl Sandberg
Setting goals is the first step in turning the invisible into the visible.
Tony Robbins
As I've progressed in my career, I've come to appreciate - and really value - the other attributes that define a company's success beyond the P&L: great leadership, long-term financial strength, ethical business practices, evolving business strategies, sound governance, powerful brands, values-based decision-making.
Ursula Burns
Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.
Vince Lombardi
Success or failure in business is caused more by the mental attitude even than by mental capacities.

Angie Stone
If you want to achieve things in life, you've just got to do them, and if you're talented and smart, you'll succeed.

David Attenborough
Success cannot come from standstill men. Methods change and men must change with them.
James Cash Penney
Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get.
H. Jackson Brown, Jr.
The difference between us and them, between you and success, is not that you never fail, but it's how you recover from those failures - is that you keep getting up time and time again. You figure out what you did wrong, and then you make it right. I say that to my kids every day.
Michelle Obama
Like success, failure is many things to many people. With Positive Mental Attitude, failure is a learning experience, a rung on the ladder, a plateau at which to get your thoughts in order and prepare to try again.

Every charitable act is a stepping stone toward heaven.
Henry Ward Beecher
I must admit that I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to her or his fellow human beings.
Margaret Mead
More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts.
Travis Bradberry
The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind.
W. Somerset Maugham
The success of a production depends on the attention paid to detail.

I have had all of the disadvantages required for success.
Larry Ellison
You will never win if you never begin.

Jack Nicholson
People are the key to success or extraordinary success.
Azim Premji
There's no abiding success without commitment.

Colin Powell
The reward of art is not fame or success but intoxication: that is why so many bad artists are unable to give it up.
Jean Cocteau
We've had great successes, but our future is not about our past success. It's going to be about whether we will invent things that are really going to drive our future.
Satya Nadella

The more defects a man may have, the older he is, the less lovable, the more resounding his success.
Marquis de Sade
If you don't ask, you don't get.
Stevie Wonder
Success doesn't necessarily come from breakthrough innovation but from flawless execution. A great strategy alone won't win a game or a battle; the win comes from basic blocking and tackling.
Naveen Jain
Success is nothing if you don't have the right people to share it with; you're just gonna end up lonely.
Selena Gomez
What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.
Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Matthew Prior
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.

Lily Tomlin
You can't expect to hit the jackpot if you don't put a few nickels in the machine.
Flip Wilson
For an actress to be a success, she must have the face of a Venus, the brains of a Minerva, the grace of Terpsichore, the memory of a MaCaulay, the figure of Juno, and the hide of a rhinoceros.
Ethel Barrymore
The way a team plays as a whole determines its success.
George Herman
I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.
Tennessee Williams
Oh, I would love to be a motivational speaker. I have pulled myself out of a million potholes, and I can see the potholes ahead of me. That doesn't mean that I could always do that so perfectly for my own life. I totally fall in potholes.
Drew Barrymore
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence.
Helen Keller
We do not celebrate people who have made success out of serious hard work.

Richard Lugar
We reached a high point in my opinion with the passage of the civil rights legislation and Martin Luther King's success and the crusade of others. I think we kind of breathed a sigh of relief as if we had achieved the end of racial discrimination or white supremacy.
Jimmy Carter
Happiness is the natural flower of duty.
Phillips Brooks
I wanted to do something inspirational for my children.
Harvey Weinstein
My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people.
John Philip Sousa
Success is like death. The more successful you become, the higher the houses in the hills get and the higher the fences get.
Kevin Spacey
Willpower is the key to success. Successful people strive no matter what they feel by applying their will to overcome apathy, doubt or fear.
Dan Millman
The winner's edge is not in a gifted birth, a high IQ, or in talent. The winner's edge is all in the attitude, not aptitude. Attitude is the criterion for success.
Denis Waitley
I think 'Heroes of Cosplay' will show a lot of the positive things, like how much effort it takes to make a costume. These people on the show aren't taking shortcuts. As long as that effort gets through to the viewers, we will be inspirational. Then there will be people who watch the show that want to get in and hands-on make outfits.
Yaya Han
Success is dependent on effort.
Sophocles
I think if there's something one needs to change with oneself, it doesn't have to happen in the New Year. You can do that any time you please - not that it's not a good inspirational tactic for the people that it works for.
Brittany Murphy
Courage, my friends; 'tis not too late to build a better world.

Jim Evans
Had I not come out with an inspirational CD, you perhaps would have never known that I feel like I feel, that all songs, all the music I've ever done is a gift from God.
Smokey Robinson
We just want to win. That's the bottom line. I think a lot of times people may become content with one championship or a little bit of success, but we don't really reflect on what we've done in the past. We focus on the present.
Derek Jeter
I'm lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.
Lionel Messi

Don Shula
I have looked into your eyes with my eyes. I have put my heart near your heart.

Golda Meir
Fun opens the doors to creativity, which then leads to inspiration, which then births passion, which all together equals both happiness and success!
Rachele Brooke Smith
Architecture is not an inspirational business, it's a rational procedure to do sensible and hopefully beautiful things; that's all.

What drives success, and the most successful students, is internal motivation.
Vivienne Ming
Success is the child of drudgery and perseverance. It cannot be coaxed or bribed; pay the price and it is yours.
Orison Swett Marden
Our time here is magic! It's the only space you have to realize whatever it is that is beautiful, whatever is true, whatever is great, whatever is potential, whatever is rare, whatever is unique, in. It's the only space.
Ben Okri
Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.
Leo Buscaglia
For true success ask yourself these four questions: Why? Why not? Why not me? Why not now?
James Allen
Even successful musicians have had periods where people say they suck and no one likes them, even after they've had periods of great success. So I think it's like you just gotta do you and try to stay motivated. Until, you know, you decide to stay home and make spaghetti all day.
K. Flay
We are taught to consume. And that's what we do. But if we realized that there really is no reason to consume, that it's just a mind set, that it's just an addiction, then we wouldn't be out there stepping on people's hands climbing the corporate ladder of success.
River Phoenix
I wish that the Indians believed me a god, for upon the report of an enemy's valor oftentimes depends the success of a battle, and false reports have many times done as great things as true courage and resolution.
Alexander the Great
Men judge us by the success of our efforts. God looks at the efforts themselves.
Charlotte Bronte
I think there's an awful lot of noise about the Church being persecuted but there is a more real issue that the conventional churches face - that the people who are really driving their revival and success believe in an old-time religion which, in my view, is incompatible with a modern, multi-ethnic, multicultural society.
Trevor Phillips
You never know when some small thing will lead to a big idea. Travel is very inspirational - but it's in the ordinary that I find my themes of love and work and family.
Adriana Trigiani
Without craftsmanship, inspiration is a mere reed shaken in the wind.
Johannes Brahms
Success in its highest and noblest form calls for peace of mind and enjoyment and happiness which come only to the man who has found the work that he likes best.

Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
Bill Bradley
The ladder of success is never crowded at the top.
Napoleon Hill
The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way.
Dale Carnegie
Success in life is founded upon attention to the small things rather than to the large things; to the every day things nearest to us rather than to the things that are remote and uncommon.
Booker T. Washington
What I have in common with the character in 'Truman' is this incredible need to please people. I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started.
Jim Carrey
Thelonious Monk was one of the musicians I most connected with early on. I'm a huge Betty Carter fan, and the way that Abbey Lincoln and Shirley Horn grew immensely from the time they were young is so inspirational.
Cecile McLorin Salvant
Not on one strand are all life's jewels strung.
William Morris
In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd.
Miguel de Cervantes
The historical basis for the gap between the black middle class and underclass shows that ending discrimination, by itself, would not eradicate black poverty and dysfunction. We also need intervention to promulgate a middle-class ethic of success among the poor, while expanding opportunities for economic betterment.
Henry Louis Gates
My parents are very proud of my success but still worry, as I'm in a profession where there is no guarantee of work. They have always supported my decision to go into acting, but there have been tough times work-wise.
David Harewood
Keep all special thoughts and memories for lifetimes to come. Share these keepsakes with others to inspire hope and build from the past, which can bridge to the future.
Mattie Stepanek
It is very important to know who you are. To make decisions. To show who you are.
Malala Yousafzai
Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success.

Gary Cherone
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.
Maya Angelou
The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.
Bill Frist
I really think that it's disgusting that Paris is the only place where it is illegal for paps to follow you around. It actually took someone losing their life - Diana, an inspirational woman - and then it changed, but they still won't change it in London! It's horrible!
Cara Delevingne
Lord knows, every day is not a success, every year is not a success. You have to celebrate the good.
Reese Witherspoon
God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with him.
Jim Elliot
God has already done everything He's going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you're going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family.
Joel Osteen
Success in almost any field depends more on energy and drive than it does on intelligence. This explains why we have so many stupid leaders.
Sloan Wilson
The success and the failure are not my concern, but His.
Joseph Barber Lightfoot
I do love to eavesdrop. It's inspirational, not only for subject matter but for actual dialogue, the way people talk.
Lynda Barry
Every success story has a parent who says, 'over my dead body.' Every success story has an old person who walks up to you and says, when you're acting the fool, 'you know I worry about you sometimes.'
Bill Cosby
Success in business today requires real-time, mobile access to business opportunities.
Bob McDonnell
Management is efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning against the right wall.

If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you never will change the outcome.
Michael Jordan
We convince by our presence.
Walt Whitman
Always desire to learn something useful.
Sophocles
In the United States there's a Puritan ethic and a mythology of success. He who is successful is good. In Latin countries, in Catholic countries, a successful person is a sinner.
Umberto Eco
If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.
Isaac Newton
I think the biggest challenge is to continue on the same path. I think it's easy to become complacent from the success you've had.

The dog that trots about finds a bone.
Golda Meir
The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best.
Epictetus

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed.
Blaise Pascal
I wrote '('Til) I Kissed You' about a girl I met in Australia. Her name was Lilian, and she was very, very inspirational. I was married, but... I wrote the song about her on the way back home.
Don Everly
We learned about gratitude and humility - that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean... and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect.
Michelle Obama
I'd like to one day be featured on a list of inspirational people who have made a difference in the world, whether it be helping underprivileged people or putting an end to the poaching of wildlife in Africa.

Victor Hugo
To get down to the quick of it, respect motivates me - not success.
Hugh Jackman
It's how you deal with failure that determines how you achieve success.
Charlotte Whitton
Success consists in being successful, not in having potential for success. Any wide piece of ground is the potential site of a palace, but there's no palace till it's built.
Fernando Pessoa
That should be the measure of success for everyone. It's not money, it's not fame, it's not celebrity; my index of success is happiness.
Lupe Fiasco
Within the hearts men, loyalty and consideration are esteemed greater than success.
Bryant H. McGill
Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.
Paul J. Meyer
You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else.
Unknown
A tragic irony of life is that we so often achieve success or financial independence after the chief reason for which we sought it has passed away.
Ellen Glasgow
God sleeps in the minerals, awakens in plants, walks in animals, and thinks in man.
Arthur Young
True leaders don't invest in buildings. Jesus never built a building. They invest in people. Why? Because success without a successor is failure. So your legacy should not be in buildings, programs, or projects; your legacy must be in people.
Myles Munroe
Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts.
John Wooden
Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.
Andre Gide
All those who are around me are the bridge to my success, so they are all important.

Alexandre Dumas
Always remember that striving and struggle precede success, even in the dictionary.
Sarah Ban Breathnach
I was sure I'd set the world on fire, and it was hard for a young feller like me to realize the truth - that I hadn't set the world on fire, and I was totally unprepared to handle the consequences if 'The Big Trail' had been a success and launched me as a star.
John Wayne
If you can figure out my success on the screen, you're a better man than I.
Alan Ladd
What were once only hopes for the future have now come to pass; it is almost exactly 13 years since the overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and Northern Ireland voted in favour of the agreement signed on Good Friday 1998, paving the way for Northern Ireland to become the exciting and inspirational place that it is today.
Queen Elizabeth II

e. e. cummings
I want to make this world perfect.
Malala Yousafzai
At the end of the day, you are solely responsible for your success and your failure.

As long as you blame others for the reason you aren't where you want to be, you will always be a failure.

I've worked too hard and too long to let anything stand in the way of my goals. I will not let my teammates down and I will not let myself down.
Mia Hamm
You will be a failure, until you impress the subconscious with the conviction you are a success. This is done by making an affirmation which 'clicks.'
Florence Scovel Shinn
'No one can make you successful; the will to success comes from within.' I've made this my motto. I've internalized it to the point of understanding that the success of my actions and/or endeavors doesn't depend on anyone else, and that includes a possible failure.
Fabrizio Moreira
I love inspirational R&B, like Mary J. Blige and Jennifer Hudson. I want to do that. That kind of music stays with you.
Ashthon Jones
You just hope that you will get the opportunity to do what you love and pay your bills, and that is being a success as an actor.

Gary Ryan Blair
Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over.
F. Scott Fitzgerald
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
Alfred A. Montapert
Awards are not the only markers of success; I don't judge myself just based on them. I believe that each cinema-goer has his own mental trophies.

Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success.

Robert Kiyosaki
The undertaking of a new action brings new strength.
Richard L. Evans
The foundation of success in life is good health: that is the substratum fortune; it is also the basis of happiness. A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick.
P. T. Barnum
I worked at The Old Globe Theater under the great baton of Craig Noel. One of the great theater heroes that we have. He was so great and so inspirational. I think I did 'Antony and Cleopatra' and 'The Taming of the Shrew'. I lived in Ocean Beach, and my rent was $140 a month.
Jeffrey Tambor
A man has to learn that he cannot command things, but that he can command himself; that he cannot coerce the wills of others, but that he can mold and master his own will: and things serve him who serves Truth; people seek guidance of him who is master of himself.

Oprah Winfrey
We've been surrounded by images of space our whole lives, from the speculative images of science fiction to the inspirational visions of artists to the increasingly beautiful pictures made possible by complex technologies. But whilst we have an overwhelmingly vivid visual understanding of space, we have no sense of what space sounds like.
Honor Harger
To this day, just always treat people the way you want to be treated. Whether it's family or friends or co-workers, I think it's the most important thing. Whether you have success or don't have it, whether you're a good person is all that matters.

Success is not a place at which one arrives but rather the spirit with which one undertakes and continues the journey.

Christine Pelosi
Wherever you are - be all there.

Bill Kurtis
I attribute my success to this - I never gave or took any excuse.
Florence Nightingale
I believe in the city as a natural human environment, but we must humanize it. It's art that will re-define public space in the 21st Century. We can make our cities diverse, inspirational places by putting art, dance and performance in all its forms into the matrix of street life.
Antony Gormley
There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.
Niccolo Machiavelli
If you work just for money, you'll never make it, but if you love what you're doing and you always put the customer first, success will be yours.
Ray Kroc
Inspirational leaders need to have a winning mentality in order to inspire respect. It is hard to trust in the leadership of someone who is half-hearted about their purpose, or only sporadic in focus or enthusiasm.
Sebastian Coe
It's harder to be a success, globally, and be artistic. Harder to have that balance than just to be artistic when nobody understands you.
Andre Benjamin
We help people to begin truly healthful diets, and it is absolutely wonderful to see, not only their success, but also their delight at their ability to break old habits and feel really healthy for a change.
Neal Barnard
The hardest thing to find in life is balance - especially the more success you have, the more you look to the other side of the gate. What do I need to stay grounded, in touch, in love, connected, emotionally balanced? Look within yourself.
Celine Dion
The decadent international but individualistic capitalism in the hands of which we found ourselves after the war is not a success. It is not intelligent. It is not beautiful. It is not just. It is not virtuous. And it doesn't deliver the goods.

I define success as being comfortable with yourself and your life. And that is about as good as it gets, really.
Treat Williams
Go big or go home. Because it's true. What do you have to lose?
Eliza Dushku
Who would have thought that a tap-dancing penguin would outpoint James Bond at the box office? And deserve to? Not that there's anything wrong with 'Casino Royale.' But 'Happy Feet' - written and directed by George Miller - is a complete charmer, even if, in the way of most family fare, it can't resist straying into the Inspirational.
Robert Gottlieb
The only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand, and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves on the other.
H. G. Wells
The more things you do, the more you can do.

Gordon B. Hinckley
Never retreat. Never explain. Get it done and let them howl.
Benjamin Jowett
Action is the foundational key to all success.
Pablo Picasso
President Obama called for a 'we' nation in his Inauguration Address. Art convenes. It is not just inspirational. It is aspirational. It pricks the walls of our compartmentalized minds, opens our hearts and makes us brave. And that's what we need most in our country today.
Anna Deavere Smith
Success is due to our stretching to the challenges of life. Failure comes when we shrink from them.
John C. Maxwell
It is the hopeful, buoyant, cheerful attitude of mind that wins. Optimism is a success builder; pessimism an achievement killer.
Orison Swett Marden

That's the key to success, isn't it? It has to be fun.
Monica Seles
I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success.
Christie Hefner
Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good.
Vaclav Havel
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.
W. Clement Stone

Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed.
Emily Dickinson
Success is dependent upon the glands - sweat glands.
Zig Ziglar
Success is the one unpardonable sin against our fellows.

Leonardo da Vinci
More power than all the success slogans ever penned by human hand is the realization for every man that he has but one boss. That boss is the man - he - himself.
Gabriel Heatter
Success is not only one thing. It's not only having a nice house in Beverly Hills and driving a nice Mercedes.
Malik Bendjelloul
Hopefully, when people see 'Senna', they will understand why this inspirational story needed to be told, why it had to be made as a movie for the big screen, and why it is a film for everyone.
Asif Kapadia
Almost every college playwright or sketch or improv comedian was sort of aware of Christopher Durang - even kids in high school. His short plays were so accessible to younger people and I think that was inspirational to me.
Mindy Kaling
Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.
Viktor E. Frankl
If you wish to be a success in the world, promise everything, deliver nothing.
Napoleon Bonaparte
I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.
Nikola Tesla
The more tranquil a man becomes, the greater is his success, his influence, his power for good. Calmness of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom.
James Allen
Success means having the courage, the determination, and the will to become the person you believe you were meant to be.
George A. Sheehan
I have a tendency to sabotage relationships; I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts.
Michael Buble
I'm not going to get somewhere and say, 'OK, I'm done.' Success is never final; I'll just keep on going. The same way as failure never being fatal. Just keep going. I'm going to the stars and then past them.
Conor McGregor
Get action. Seize the moment. Man was never intended to become an oyster.
Theodore Roosevelt
You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream.

Marvin Sapp
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay.
Simone de Beauvoir
Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self; their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression.
Leonard Mlodinow
Since we launched the original 'Pop Idol' in England, I've remained close with Simon Fuller. Working as executive producer on 'American idol' for its first seven years not only was an inspirational journey into the heart of American pop culture, it opened my eyes to the untapped potential of the incredibly dynamic young people in this world.
Nigel Lythgoe
Success can make you go one of two ways. It can make you a prima donna - or it can smooth the edges, take away the insecurities, let the nice things come out.
Barbara Walters
We don't have a divine right to success. So I agree with a lot of politicians out there when they say, 'We've got serious issues.' We do: immigration, infrastructure. I think income inequality's one of them.
Jamie Dimon
Academic success depends on research and publications.
Philip Zimbardo
Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.

Richard Branson
Success is how high you bounce when you hit bottom.
George S. Patton
Work will win when wishy washy wishing won t.

Naveen Jain
The central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics, that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
The love of what you do, combined with your belief in what you do, will not determine your success. It will determine how hard you will work and how dedicated you will be to achieving it. Success just shows up from there.
Jeffrey Gitomer
Never complain and never explain.
Benjamin Disraeli
I always say be humble but be firm. Humility and openness are the key to success without compromising your beliefs.

Zane Grey
Honesty is the most single most important factor having a direct bearing on the final success of an individual, corporation, or product.

Napoleon Hill
Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
Robert H. Schuller
Hope... is the companion of power, and the mother of success; for who so hopes has within him the gift of miracles.

Arthur Schopenhauer

Tommy Lasorda
Education is the key to success in life, and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students.
Solomon Ortiz
Where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a chance in a million that you can do something, anything, to keep what you want from ending, do it. Pry the door open or, if need be, wedge your foot in that door and keep it open.
Pauline Kael
Passion is what gives meaning to our lives. It's what allows us to achieve success beyond our wildest imagination. Try to find a career path that you have a passion for.

Simon Cowell
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.
Pele
I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.
Noel Gallagher
The things that we love tell us what we are.
Thomas Aquinas

Anne Rice
True success, true happiness lies in freedom and fulfillment.
Dada Vaswani
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.
Steve Jobs
I don't know what it's like to have a typical father figure. He's not the dad who's going to take me to the beach and go swimming, but he's such a motivational person.
Tiffany Trump

Sammy Davis, Jr.
Finding good partners is the key to success in anything: in business, in marriage and, especially, in investing.

Michael Gove
Success is usually the culmination of controlling failure.
Sylvester Stallone
Microsoft has had two goals in the last 10 years. One was to copy the Mac, and the other was to copy Lotus' success in the spreadsheet - basically, the applications business. And over the course of the last 10 years, Microsoft accomplished both of those goals. And now they are completely lost.
Steve Jobs
The one phrase you can use is that success has a thousand fathers, and failure is an orphan.
Alan Price
It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them.

St. Jerome
Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
Albert Einstein
When it comes to social consequences, they've got all different people acting in different ways, very difficult to even have a proper criterion of success. So, it's a difficult task.
George Soros
All of us are born for a reason, but all of us don't discover why. Success in life has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself. It's what you do for others.

Pele
When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore.

Success is not a matter of mastering subtle, sophisticated theory but rather of embracing common sense with uncommon levels of discipline and persistence.

Lindsey Wixson
Humor has bailed me out of more tight situations than I can think of. If you go with your instincts and keep your humor, creativity follows. With luck, success comes, too.
Jimmy Buffett
Success is neither magical nor mysterious. Success is the natural consequence of consistently applying the basic fundamentals.

It's a special person - and personality - who can lead a start-up to soaring success and sustain that success for the long term. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg are star examples.

Shah Rukh Khan

Sophie Kinsella
You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing. You don't have to do anything to earn it. Your shortcomings, your lack of self-esteem, physical perfection, or social and economic success - none of that matters. No one can take this love away from you, and it will always be here.
Ram Dass
I cannot give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure - which is: Try to please everybody.
Herbert Bayard Swope
My father, Oliver Hynes, was an educator. He was originally just a teacher, a very good one, but then he was promoted to be in charge of education for the entire area.

Garry Hynes
If you want to succeed you should strike out on new paths, rather than travel the worn paths of accepted success.

Audrey Hepburn
Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, Or what's a heaven for?
Robert Browning
The optimist underestimates how difficult it is to achieve real change, believing that anything is possible and it's possible now. Only by confronting head-on the reality that all progress is going to be obstructed by vested interests and corrupted by human venality can we create realistic programmes that actually have a chance of success.
Julian Baggini
A hero is someone who has given his or her life to something bigger than oneself.

Robert Fulghum
Whether you're successful or not, you'll never actually feel the joys of accomplishment unless you love yourself. Success can be very difficult to deal with. You have to stay in the center. If you let your success define you, then you're really just setting yourself up for failure.

Diligence is the mother of good fortune.
Benjamin Disraeli
I'm always asked, 'What's the secret to success?' But there are no secrets. Be humble. Be hungry. And always be the hardest worker in the room.
Dwayne Johnson
Success isn't always going to be a huge contract; success is going to be if you just live out your purpose in life.
Allan Houston

John Donne
We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.
Whoopi Goldberg
Too many people measure how successful they are by how much money they make or the people that they associate with. In my opinion, true success should be measured by how happy you are.

Richard Branson

Jessica Savitch
Success is the sum of small efforts - repeated day in and day out.
Robert Collier
Success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues; tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism.
Walter Lippmann
There is probably a perverse pride in my administration... that we were going to do the right thing, even if short-term it was unpopular. And I think anybody who's occupied this office has to remember that success is determined by an intersection in policy and politics and that you can't be neglecting of marketing and P.R. and public opinion.
Barack Obama
Obedience brings success; exact obedience brings miracles.
Russell M. Nelson

Confucius
Yes I have made a lot of money and I have a lot of respect, my films have done well, and I know there are loads of loads of people who look up to me and really love me. I really just thought this is like a strange dream. I have never thought this is a success - I don't have a standard.
Shah Rukh Khan
Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.
Alexander Graham Bell
There have been many different artists that have been inspirational. I suppose the question is directed to what was the reason why I went into fantasy illustration.

Gustave Flaubert
A champion is someone who gets up when he can't.
Jack Dempsey
Inside, I've got a real purist desire and dream about the music. I like the idea of being able to carve out a kind of magical, colourful, artistic, inspirational life.

Heather Bresch
I will always desire to play with Bruce Springsteen. He's the most inspirational, most dedicated, most committed and most focused artist I've ever seen. I like to be around people like that.
Max Weinberg
Personally, I can't see the appeal in trekking down to D.C. for a networking extravaganza, even if it is built around a special moment in American history. While I find the election of Barack Obama inspirational, I don't have a desire to memorialize it with overly effusive celebration.
Jamie Johnson
If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree.
Jim Rohn
The only thing that ultimately matters is to eat an ice-cream cone, play a slide trombone, plant a small tree, good God, now you're free.

James Rouse
The measure of success is happiness and peace of mind.
Bobby Davro
As long as I'm not selling out the people that ride or die with me, I'm glad I'm not an MC. I'm a motivational speaker. I'm not that rapper dude.
Young Jeezy
Look at a football field. It looks like a big movie screen. This is theatre. Football combines the strategy of chess. It's part ballet. It's part battleground, part playground. We clarify, amplify and glorify the game with our footage, the narration and that music, and in the end create an inspirational piece of footage.
Steve Sabol
A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.
Mark Twain
It is only in sorrow bad weather masters us; in joy we face the storm and defy it.
Amelia Barr
The only way to permanently change the temperature in the room is to reset the thermostat. In the same way, the only way to change your level of financial success 'permanently' is to reset your financial thermostat. But it is your choice whether you choose to change.
T. Harv Eker
As my family story shows, Latinos have been a blessing for USA for many generations. The future of America depends in part on the success of the Latino community, and this opportunity is just one more signifier of that.
Julian Castro
My success has been something I've worked a long time at and it's been a gradual process. I compare it to the idea of someone losing a lot of weight over a period of a few years. You don't really notice the weight loss overall but if you compare photos from then and now there's a big difference.
Ray William Johnson

Jose Mourinho
Success is not assured, but America is resolute: this is the best chance for peace we are likely to see for some years to come - and we are acting to help Israelis and Palestinians seize this chance.

Bob Dylan
The key to success is action, and the essential in action is perseverance.

Robert Orben
Put your heart, mind, and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.
Swami Sivananda
One of the things that I did before I ran for president is I was a professional speaker. Not a motivational speaker - an inspirational speaker. Motivation comes from within. You have to be inspired. That's what I do. I inspire people, I inspire the public, I inspire my staff. I inspired the organizations I took over to want to succeed.
Herman Cain
Success breeds success.
Mia Hamm
Success in the majority of circumstances depends on knowing how long it takes to succeed.

Marcus Garvey
In order to succeed you must fail, so that you know what not to do the next time.
Anthony J. D'Angelo
The turning point was when I hit my 30th birthday. I thought, if really want to write, it's time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book.
James Rollins
If I had permitted my failures, or what seemed to me at the time a lack of success, to discourage me I cannot see any way in which I would ever have made progress.
Calvin Coolidge
I believe that being successful means having a balance of success stories across the many areas of your life. You can't truly be considered successful in your business life if your home life is in shambles.
Zig Ziglar
I've been known to write 10 pages a day for 10 days running before I take a breath. I am not a disciplined writer. I'm one of those people who laughingly call themselves inspirational writers, which basically means someone who has no control over their own creative process.
Catherine Ryan Hyde
What material success does is provide you with the ability to concentrate on other things that really matter. And that is being able to make a difference, not only in your own life, but in other people's lives.
Oprah Winfrey

Henry Ford
Enthusiasm moves the world.
Arthur Balfour
I found it interesting that as people become more technically oriented all over the world, at the same time people are becoming increasingly spiritual. The success of the Da Vinci code - even though it was a great yawn - also showed people's interest in religion.
Barbara Walters
Problems or successes, they all are the results of our own actions. Karma. The philosophy of action is that no one else is the giver of peace or happiness. One's own karma, one's own actions are responsible to come to bring either happiness or success or whatever.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success.
Irving Berlin
Socialism has no moral justification whatsoever; poor people are not morally superior to rich people, nor are they owed anything by rich people simply because of their lack of success. Charity is not a socialist concept - it is a religious one, an acknowledgment of God's sovereignty over property, a sovereignty the Left utterly rejects.
Ben Shapiro
When you win, nothing hurts.
Joe Namath

I view art as an inspirational tool.

A place for everything, everything in its place.
Benjamin Franklin
I was perceived to be a first- to third-rounder. I kind of had a tough junior year and fell to the fifth round. At that time, it was motivational.

Henri Nouwen
If you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy.
Dale Carnegie
Dullness in matters of government is a good sign, and not a bad one - in particular, dullness in parliamentary government is a test of its excellence, an indication of its success.
Walter Bagehot
How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains!
John Muir
Growing up in a group home, and with an undiagnosed learning disability to boot, the odds of success were not on my side. But when I joined the high school football team, I learned the value of discipline, focus, persistence, and teamwork - all skills that have proven vital to my career as a C.E.O. and social entrepreneur.
Darell Hammond
Success is an absurd, erratic thing. She arrives when one least expects her and after she has come may depart again almost because of a whim.

Elbert Hubbard

Unknown
To be wholly devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded in life.
Robert Louis Stevenson
Never did a government commence under auspices so favorable, nor ever was success so complete.

Alfred Adler
I've had a lot of success; I've had failures, so I learn from the failure.
Gordon Ramsay
Our worldly successes cannot be guaranteed, but our ability to achieve spiritual success is entirely up to us, thanks to the grace of God. The best advice I know is to give is to give those worldly things your best but never your all - reserve the ultimate hope for the only one who can grant it.
Mitt Romney
Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.

A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
I honestly think it is better to be a failure at something you love than to be a success at something you hate.
George Burns
Anything that won't sell, I don't want to invent. Its sale is proof of utility, and utility is success.

Kyle Chandler
Hopefully I'll continue to have the success I've had.
Tiger Woods
Books are challenging and inspirational to me.
Amy Sedaris
Hip-hop is more about attaining wealth. People respect success. They respect big. They don't even have to like your music. If you're big enough, people are drawn to you.
Jay-Z
Sometimes we may ask God for success, and He gives us physical and mental stamina. We might plead for prosperity, and we receive enlarged perspective and increased patience, or we petition for growth and are blessed with the gift of grace. He may bestow upon us conviction and confidence as we strive to achieve worthy goals.
David A. Bednar

Jane D. Hull
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.
Og Mandino
I'm happy to be on a winning team. My individual success, that lasts for a short period of time. The success of being a part of the South, of Atlanta, which is now the hot bed of music, that's what's gonna last the longest. The fact that I contributed to planting our flag and moving music to my city, that's what I'm most proud of.
T.I.
For success of any mission, it is necessary to have creative leadership. Creative leadership is vital for government, non-governmental organisations as well as for industries.

Confucius
America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.
Sigmund Freud
When I meet with the founders of a new company, my advice is almost always, 'Do fewer things.' It's true of partnerships, marketing opportunities, anything that's taking up your time. The vast majority of things are distractions, and very few really matter to your success.

It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
Aristotle
You create your opportunities by asking for them.
Shakti Gawain
Do your work with your whole heart, and you will succeed - there's so little competition.

We're in a situation where talented, motivated school leavers and graduates can send off a hundred CVs and not get a reply, and where a trip to the Job Centre is depressing rather than inspirational. And you know what, that just feels wrong.
Jameela Jamil
There are glimpses of heaven to us in every act, or thought, or word, that raises us above ourselves.
Robert Quillen
When one side benefits more than the other, that's a win-lose situation. To the winner it might look like success for a while, but in the long run, it breeds resentment and distrust.
Stephen Covey
People think your success is just a matter of having a pretty face. But it's easy to be chewed up and spat out. You've got to stay ahead of the game to be able to stay in it.
Kate Moss
I am an enthusiast, but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine. I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success.
Wilbur Wright
I've always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up.

Alex Rodriguez
I'd rather attempt to do something great and fail than to attempt to do nothing and succeed.
Robert H. Schuller

Joyce Brothers
The successful man doesn't use others, other people use the successful man, for above all the success is of service.
Mark Caine
My career started young and I was really ambitious, and then I had success and I hung out with people who were much older. I think I might have been temporally misplaced, so I thought I was 40. It was a premature midlife crisis.
Elizabeth Gilbert
Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.
Henry David Thoreau
It's as if inside the White House the belief in Obama's inspirational charisma is still such that every time the ugliness of brute politics intrudes, it's a startling revelation.
Tina Brown
When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.

Calvin Klein
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you.
Ralph Waldo Emerson
A human being has so many skins inside, covering the depths of the heart. We know so many things, but we don't know ourselves! Why, thirty or forty skins or hides, as thick and hard as an ox's or bear's, cover the soul. Go into your own ground and learn to know yourself there.
Meister Eckhart
The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.

A friend of mine said something powerful at his grandfather's funeral.

Larry Flynt
You are always free to change your mind and choose a different future, or a different past.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

Shirley Jones
My store, Wine Library, outsells big national chains. How do you think we do it? It started with hustle. I always say that our success wasn't due to my hundreds of online videos about wine that went viral, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.

The funny thing about having all this so-called success is that behind it is a certain horrible emptiness.

Chris Benz
It's not enough that I should succeed - others should fail.
David Merrick
The system that enables the most people to earn the most success is free enterprise, by matching up people's skills, interests, and abilities. In contrast, redistribution simply spreads money around. Even worse, it attenuates the ability to earn success by perverting economic incentives.

Barbara Bush
Failures to heroic minds are the stepping stones to success.

When I ran the stock exchange, it was the most successful it's been in its 200-plus-year history. And I was rewarded for success; I would not have been rewarded if we failed.

No self-respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party who ignores her sex.

Francis of Assisi
The essential elements of giving are power and love - activity and affection - and the consciousness of the race testifies that in the high and appropriate exercise of these is a blessedness greater than any other.

Mark Kennedy
The secret of our success is that we never, never give up.

Charles J. Givens
If someone says 'grunge' or 'punk,' you know what the sound is, but if you say 'No Wave,' it's kind of mysterious. That was the most interesting part and should have been the most inspirational thing about it... here's this collective sonic insanity, and none of it sounds anything alike.

The time I had waited probably made the difference between success and failure.
Anna Neagle
There is progress whether ye are going forward or backward! The thing is to move!

Guy Laliberte
Personal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success.
Denis Waitley
Brand is not a product, that's for sure; it's not one item. It's an idea, it's a theory, it's a meaning, it's how you carry yourself. It's aspirational, it's inspirational.

I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it. But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.
Carol Ann Duffy
To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.
Bessie Anderson Stanley

Johnny Weir
Honesty and integrity are absolutely essential for success in life - all areas of life. The really good news is that anyone can develop both honesty and integrity.

Andrew Stanton
There is little success where there is little laughter.
Andrew Carnegie

Keep your feet on the ground, but let your heart soar as high as it will. Refuse to be average or to surrender to the chill of your spiritual environment.
Arthur Helps
The number of stressors has multiplied exponentially: traffic, money, success, work/life balance, the economy, the environment, parenting, family conflict, relationships, disease. As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn't been able to keep up.
Andrew J. Bernstein
Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.

Success is steady progress toward one's personal goals.
Jim Rohn
Give Obama a script he has made his own, and he is the motivational speaker to end all speakers. Tony Robbins cloned with Honest Abe.

Lilly Singh
What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.
Plutarch
People tell you the world looks a certain way. Parents tell you how to think. Schools tell you how to think. TV. Religion. And then at a certain point, if you're lucky, you realize you can make up your own mind. Nobody sets the rules but you. You can design your own life.

David Cameron
A true friend is one who overlooks your failures and tolerates your success!
Doug Larson
Challenge is the pathway to engagement and progress in our lives. But not all challenges are created equal. Some challenges make us feel alive, engaged, connected, and fulfilled. Others simply overwhelm us. Knowing the difference as you set bigger and bolder challenges for yourself is critical to your sanity, success, and satisfaction.
Brendon Burchard
Success is a terrible thing and a wonderful thing. If you can enjoy it, it's wonderful. If it starts eating away at you, and they're waiting for more from me, or what can I do to top this, then you're in trouble. Just do what you love. That's all I want to do.
Gene Wilder
Humility is the true key to success. Successful people lose their way at times. They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits of success. Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap. Humble people share the credit and wealth, remaining focused and hungry to continue the journey of success.
Rick Pitino
If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do.

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world, except money.

Christian de Duve
One of the rewards of success is freedom, the ability to do whatever you like.

William James
I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today!

Alberto Giacometti
It is the combination of reasonable talent and the ability to keep going in the face of defeat that leads to success.

Paul J. Meyer
Being happy is of the utmost importance. Success in anything is through happiness.
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

Marie Curie
One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work. But... I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success.
Thomas A. Edison
In the end, you make your reputation and you have your success based upon credibility and being able to provide people who are really hungry for information what they want.
Brit Hume

Johnny Carson
My childhood, adolescence and high school days are unusually important. If there has ever been a time that I developed a uniqueness and sense of humor and the ability to organize, it was then. In those early days, I developed the skills that gave me a certain degree of success in American politics.
Lee Atwater
Why be a man when you can be a success?
Bertolt Brecht

I thought 'Moulin Rouge' was inspirational, and 'Jesus Christ Superstar' I loved.
Pierce Brosnan
Your personal life, your professional life, and your creative life are all intertwined. I went through a few very difficult years where I felt like a failure.

Christa McAuliffe
Our goals can only be reached through a vehicle of a plan, in which we must fervently believe, and upon which we must vigorously act. There is no other route to success.
Pablo Picasso
Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers.
Amy Waldman
Despite the success cult, men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of the effort involved in getting there - or failing to get there.

My tastes and inspirational artists were always rather eclectic and diverse.

Steve Garvey
Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.
Robert Frost
My first book was called, 'Mountain, Get Out of My Way,' where I did an autobiographical sketch, if you will, looking back at myself and looking back at things in my life, and juxtaposing them against things that are happening in other people's lives and trying to be motivational.
Montel Williams
How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.

Robert Baden-Powell
When I was working at the Sprint store, I got laid off. I was bummed out, but I stayed positive. I used the money I had earned while working there to make my first album. Without that job, maybe 'Corazon Sin Cara' would never had been made. It's a very inspirational story.
Prince Royce
Applause waits on success.
Benjamin Franklin
Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend. Non-being is the greatest joy.
Lao Tzu
Good ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate success for an athlete who possesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an overpriced pair of sneakers. Sports shoes don't win races. Athletes do.

Elmer Bernstein
Success doesn't mean that you are healthy, success doesn't mean that you're happy, success doesn't mean that you're rested. Success really doesn't mean that you look good, or feel good, or are good.
Victoria Principal
Tell me, why is the media here so negative? Why are we in India so embarrassed to recognise our own strengths, our achievements? We are such a great nation. We have so many amazing success stories but we refuse to acknowledge them. Why?

Elizabeth Taylor
You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.
Napoleon Hill
Success and failure are equally disastrous.
Tennessee Williams
What's on my playlist when I'm fighting is not so much hip-hop. Sometimes, it's something more inspirational. I get a chance to think about what I'm fighting for, like, my family. It takes me to that state because a lot of times, it's a spiritual warfare for me.
Tyron Woodley
The government will see that human spaceflight is useful - for science and the economy - and inspirational.

Nathaniel Hawthorne
My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day.

Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.

Napoleon Hill
